  <p>
    The <strong>Ergasia</strong> web application provides a modern digital platform
    for citizens to submit official requests to public services,
    upload supporting documents, and monitor the progress of their applications
    in real time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through a secure authentication system, users can manage their requests,
    schedule appointments, and receive updates, while public employees
    can efficiently review, process, and complete submitted applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ergasia aims to simplify administrative procedures,
    improve transparency, and reduce processing time
    by offering a centralized and user-friendly online service.
